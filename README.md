## Requirements

Getting the j extension for VS Code to work involves two steps: 1.
Install VS Code, 2. Install the j extension.
Assuming you've installed [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to install the j extension, start VS Code. Inside VS Code, go to the extensions view either by
executing the ``View: Show Extensions`` command (click View->Command Palette...)
or by clicking on the extension icon on the left side of the VS Code
window.

In the extensions view, simply search for the term ``j`` in the marketplace
search box, then select the j extension and click the install button.
You might have to restart VS Code after this step.
